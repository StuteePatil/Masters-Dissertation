# Implementation of a Machine Learning algorithm for re-designing synthetic DNA using Codon Optimisation

## Abstract - 
Synthetic Biology has made significant progress in the areas of DNA sequencing and synthesis. Construction of synthetic genetic circuits has been automated through use of various toolkits that support integration of biological parts. The parts differ in nucleotide sequence across organisms, thereby hindering expression of foreign genes in the host organism. In this project we aim at analysing the patterns in Yeast protein coding sequences that can be used to alter the foreign gene without affecting the underlying amino acid sequence. The redesigned sequence can perhaps enhance the expression of foreign gene in the host organism. We treat DNA sequences analogous to the sentences in a natural language. Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques are applied to study the codon usage patterns in Yeast genome that can be used to find optimal protein coding sequences for the heterologous genes through codon optimisation. The results show an impressive accuracy of over 90% in predicting the codons, while the underlying amino acid sequence of the protein molecule remains unaffected.
